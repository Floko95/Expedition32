# Enhanced Timeline

Enhanced Timeline allows leveraging the Unity Timeline for designing complex animation sequences and seamlessly integrating them into gameplay.

Skip the hassle of programming delays with code, and configuring start/stop times, hitbox activations, and so on in the inspector. With the Enhanced Timeline, you can use and extend Unity's Timeline to set these up as custom Markers or Clips with minimal code. The Enhanced Timeline also supports networking out of the box.
